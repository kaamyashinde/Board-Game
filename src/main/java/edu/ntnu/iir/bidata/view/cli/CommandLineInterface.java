/**
 * The CommandLineInterface class provides a command-line-based interface for playing a board game.
 * It handles the initialization of the game, facilitates player interactions, and manages game
 * flow. The class utilizes a {@link Scanner} to receive user inputs and displays game progress
 * through the console.
 *
 * <p>Key Features: - Allows players to interact with the board game through text-based inputs. -
 * Manages the game flow, including player turns, dice rolls, and tile actions. - Prints the current
 * game state, round results, and the final winner of the game. - Supports a setup phase to register
 * players. - Logs game progress and events for better debugging.
 *
 * <p>Dependencies: - Requires a {@link BoardGame} instance to handle game-related operations such
 * as player moves, tile actions, and determining the game state.

   * time. The method includes:
   *
   * <p>- Welcoming the player and displaying the game rules. - Setting up players via user input. -
   * Initiating and controlling the main game loop. - Handling player actions such as rolling dice
   * and updating positions. - Displaying round summaries and the final winner at the end of the
   * game.
   *
   * <p>The method remains in a loop until the game condition is met (game over). Player actions
   * such as dice rolls and tile-specific events or actions during each turn are logged and
   * displayed to the players.
   *
   * <p>This method also handles edge cases such as ensuring the minimum number of players required
   * to start the game and handling tile-based actions or consequences based on the game rules.
